      KOMPOST: A residence project of New Noardic Wave, Popfabryk, Media Art
      Festival LUNA and European Media Art Festival

      *KOMPOST: Nahrung für den Geist* creates a free artistic context for a
      collaborative artist-in-residence in the Frisian countryside, with a focus
      on the landscape and the role we play in it by eating, living and working
      there. Ten sound and image makers from Friesland and the German region of
      Osnabrück jointly realized an audiovisual production in ten days, using
      the local landscape as a starting point. The resulting works are presented
      at Media Art Festival - LUNA in Leeuwarden in 2022 and at the European
      Media Art Festival in Osnabrück.
