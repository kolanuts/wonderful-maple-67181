      *KOMPOST: Nahrung für den Geist* creates a free artistic context for a
      collaborative artist-in-residence in the Frisian countryside, with a focus
      on the landscape and the role we play in it by eating, living and working
      there. Ten sound and image makers from the Netherlands and Germany jointly
      realized an audiovisual production in ten days, using the local landscape
      as a starting point. The resulting works are presented at Media Art
      Festival - LUNA in Leeuwarden in 2022 and at the European Media Art
      Festival in Osnabrück.


      At the end of the week, we presented our work to the festival directors
      and the press. Because we wanted everybody to enjoy the fantastic view
      over the dyke while listening to the music, we set up wireless headphones
      on top of the silo nearby. After all, this is the landscape that inspired
      everything this week, from the food we eat to the discussions we had to
      the art we made. The experience was accompanied by a drink made from
      beetroot syrup, a very local food, which was also made by one of the
      artists.


      Here’s what the landscape sounded like to me:
